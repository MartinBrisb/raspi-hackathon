# raspi-hackathon

* for me working files are in build/2018-08-23_working. Copy boot/ to boot partition
* kernel modules can manually be copied from build/kernel_modules to /lib/, instead of make modules_install
* to boot the customized kernel, append kernel=Kernel-Hackathon.img
* the Hackathon device tree is no included yet
* I screwed up to commit my working .config, because it was in .gitignore. The most recent .config is being compiled and checked atm. The older .config is commited too, but can't validate it's the working one.
